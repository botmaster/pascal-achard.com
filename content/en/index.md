## About me

> This site is a pretext to experiment with technologies and development methods. It is in constant evolution.

I am a **senior front-end developer** with 7 years of experience and over 20 years of professional experience building websites and web applications. I specialize in **JavaScript/TypeScript** and have expertise in the **Vue.js/Nuxt.js** framework.

My professional days are mainly focused on the design and development of web applications built with javascript frameworks (Vue.js, Alpine.js, ...) connected to APIs. I participate in design sessions and agile rituals. I am concerned about respecting the best practices of HTML/CSS integration, **performance**, respect of **graphics** (pixel perfect) and compliance with **accessibility** requirements (RGAA/WCAG).

I love **learning** new technologies, trics, methods. I like to **transmit** my knowledge and
work in a team. I spend a lot of time on technology watch and experimenting with new
tools. I have an interest in graphic design and music.

ZÃ©gut PG is a web application that allows me to create Spotify playlists from the podcast episodes of the RTL2 Pop-Rock Station show presented by Francis ZÃ©gut & Marjorie Hache. It's also an excuse for me to play around with Vue.js and the Spotify API ðŸ¤“. I talk about it [here](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/z%25C3%25A9gut-pg-cr%25C3%25A9ez-des-playlists-spotify-%25C3%25A0-partir-de-l%25C3%25A9mission-achard).

Web application that displays the titles of the songs I'm listening to on Spotify.

Project built using Node.js and npm ecosystems, Github to store the code, Render as host, Render's Redis to cache Spotify API responses. The application and internal API are built entirely using Nuxt. Nuxt is a js framework based on Vue.js that allows, among other things, server-side rendering (SSR), client-side rendering (SPA) and static site generation.

This project allowed me to put into practice Redis of which I only knew the theory. The Spotify API is very well done and particularly well documented. Nuxt.js allowed me to capitalize on my Vue.js knowledge and to quickly build a server-side rendered application. The Render platform is very useful and easy to use. It is very similar to Netlify but richer.
